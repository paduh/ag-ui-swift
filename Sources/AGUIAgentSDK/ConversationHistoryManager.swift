/// Thread-safe manager for conversation history across multiple threads.
///
/// `ConversationHistoryManager` maintains separate message histories for each
/// conversation thread, providing automatic trimming and thread-safe access.
///
/// ## Thread Management
///
/// Each thread has its own independent conversation history, identified by
/// a string thread ID (e.g., "default", "user-123", "session-abc").
///
/// ## History Trimming
///
/// When trimming, the manager preserves system messages while removing the
/// oldest user/assistant message pairs to fit within the specified limit.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let manager = ConversationHistoryManager()
///
/// // Add messages to a thread
/// await manager.append(
///     message: SystemMessage(id: "sys1", content: "You are helpful"),
///     to: "chat-1"
/// )
/// await manager.append(
///     message: UserMessage(id: "usr1", content: "Hello"),
///     to: "chat-1"
/// )
///
/// // Get history
/// let history = await manager.history(for: "chat-1")
/// print(history.count) // 2
///
/// // Trim to size
/// await manager.trim(threadId: "chat-1", maxLength: 10)
/// ```

    ///

    ///   - threadId: The thread identifier
